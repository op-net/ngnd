        The Next Generation Networks Design Database is a research library providing realistic optical network data for simulations and validation of next-generation network technologies. Designed for researchers and students, it offers comprehensive datasets to support comparative studies and algorithmic development in optical network design.

      <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" paragraph>
        The database has been developed through collaboration between Nel Kulakowska from{' '}

        The core dataset focuses on OSNR (Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio) measurements and corresponding link distances, computed using validated mathematical algorithms that incorporate fiber losses, amplifier noise figures, and transmission penalties. Researchers gain access to both raw distance data and calculated OSNR values, along with the underlying mathematical models.

        This database enables validation of optical network design models, comparison of link budget calculation approaches, and development of new optimization techniques for next-generation optical networks.
